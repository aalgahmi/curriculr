Duroori is a free open-source online course management and delivery system designed specifically for MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). It allows instructors to build courses and allows learners to enroll in these courses and interactively access their learning contents. It was designed to be:

- **Full-fledged**. It allows instructors to create courses, organize content into units and lectures, add videos, audios, images, documents, and scripts to lectures, build question banks and use them to create quizzes and exams to assess performance and enforce learning, set up a schedule of when a class opens and when its units and lectures appear, set up discussion forums, survey students, and publish class updates. At the same time, it allows students to browses available classes, enroll in them, attend lectures, read documents and pages, leave comments, attempt quizzes and exams, interacts with instructors and fellow students using the discussion forums, and view progress reports. For a full list of Duroosi features refer to [Features](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Features).

- **Internationalized**: I started this project because I wanted to offer my own class in Arabic. As a result, Duroosi  comes with support for two locals `en` (English) and `ar` (Arabic) and others can easily be added. Refer to [Internationalization](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Internationalization) for instructions on how to add a new locale.

- **Multi-tenant**: Duroosi comes with support for multi-tenancy. Tenants are called accounts (which are different form user accounts) and completely separate from one another and feels and acts as if they are their one separate site.  Each account (tenant) has its own configuration, courses, classes, users and look and feel. Refer to [Multitenancy](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Multitenancy) for more information on Duroosi multi-tenancy.

- **Themeable**: Duroosi supports themes determine the look and feel of its pages. It comes with theme based on Twitter Bootstrap with four flavors (colors if you will) to it. And because Duroosi support theme inheritance, new themes as easily be added as to provide a name and change a few CSS style classes. [Theming](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Theming) provides more information on creating a new theme.

- **Extensible**: And because thereâ€™s always going to be features that are needed or nice to have that Duroosi does not provide out of the box, Duroosi was designed to extensible by means of other gems, plugins or mountable engines. Refer to [Extensions](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Extensions) for more information on how to extend Duroosi.

## Requirements
On the client side and out of the box, duroosi comes with a theme based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com), and therefore supports all the browsers and platforms supported by it. For more information on Bootstrap 3 browser support refer to <http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support>.

On the server side, Duroosi is built using

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) &mdash; Our web application framework.
- Either [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)&mdash; Our main data store.
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) &mdash; For configuration and translations.
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) &mdash; Used for processing images.
- [RSepc](http://rspec.info) &mdash; Our testing framework.
- [SublimeVideo](http://www.sublimevideo.net) and [MediaElement.js](http://mediaelementjs.com) &mdash; For HTML5 video and audio playing.

A complete list of the gems used to in building Duroosi is found at [Gemfile](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/blob/master/Gemfile).


One of our goals is keep Duroosi as standard a Rails application as possible, so that all the best practices of Rails development and deployment can be easily leveraged.

## Installation
Before Duroosi can be deployed, the following must be done:

- Either PostgreSQL or MySQL server is installed and ready to accept connections. Change the `Gemfile` to include the gem of the database you installed.

```ruby
...

# Either postgresql  
gem 'pg'
# or mysql
#gem 'mysql2'

...
```

- Redis server is installed and ready to accept connections.
- The application *secrets* has been specified. 

### Specifying Application Secrets
To deploy Duroosi, certain piece of information (we call secrets) had to be provided. These secrets include, for instance, Rails' `secret_key_base`  or the name, email, and password of the first user (User with `id=1`) which is a special *root-like" or *super" user with ability to do anything and everything. These secrets defer from one environment to another and from one application instance to another and are stored in a file called `config/secrets.yml` and could differ from one environment to another.

As the name implies, the information contained in this file are supposed to be secrets that should not be shared at all. It's also highly advisable that it should not be included in any source control repository such as Git, Mercurial, or Subversion. Refer to [Secrets](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Secrets) for more information on the secrets file and its contents.

Duroosi comes with and example secrets file [config/secrets_exemple.yml](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/blob/master/config/secrets_example.yml) with dummy settings. To generate a secrets file based on this example file run the following:

```sh
rake duroosi:secrets:generate

```

This will create the `secrets.yml` under the `config/` folder, if it does not exit already. Open this file and make the necessary changes to it.


### Deploying the Application

Now that the application secrets are provided, you can follow the steps below to deploy Duroosi into a `development` environment.

1: Run bundler

```sh
bundle install
```

2: Create the database and run migrations

```sh
rake duroosi:db:migrate
```

3: Load the seed data

```sh
rake db:seed
```

This will create the default account(tenant) and the first user based on the information from the secrets file.

4: Reset Redis

```sh
rake duroosi:redis:reset
```

This will flush the content of Redis and import and reload Duroosi configurations and translations from file. **DO NOT** use this option if you're using redis server for other applications besides Duroosi as this task will wipe *everything* in redis. Instead run

```sh
rake duroosi:redis:load
```

**Please note that** steps 2, 3, and 4 can be combined by running

```sh
rake duroosi:bootstrap
```

5: Finally, run Rails server to start the application in development

```sh
rails server
```

### Running the Tests
To run the tests, you need to run

```sh
rake spec
```

## Other Configurations
Secrets are not the only configurations you can use to change Duroosi. There are three other kinds of configurations that can be used to change the behavior of Duroosi. These configurations are stored in Redis and can be changed through the application itself. They are from the top down:

- Site configurations: These are configurations that apply to the whole duroosi site. An example of these configuration is the `supported_locales` configuration which list all the locales recognized and supported by the site.

- Account configurations: These configurations apply only to the account (or tenant) and can be different from one account to another. Example of these configurations is the `theme` configuration which apply a specific theme to only the account being configured.

- Course configurations: These configurations apply to the course being configured and include configurations such as `grade_distribution`.

Notice that some configurations like the `locale` defined at a higher-level can be overridden in a lower-level. Refer to [Configuration](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Configuration) for more information on configuration.

## Contribution 
Contribution to this project is highly welcomed from bug fixes to new features and from new locales to new themes. Our ultimate goal is that this application will be as useful to the people as it has been to us and that overtime a community of developers and users will be formed. More information about contributing to this project is available at [Configuration](https://github.com/duroosi/duroosi/wiki/Configuration)
