    Currently, the educational systems in many of the Arab countries are failing to 
    meet the basic needs and aspirations of their constituent students, leaving 
    them on their own when it comes to acquiring the basic knowledge and skills 
    that can make a difference in their lives. At Duroosi School we are working 
    hard to change that. Taking into account the economic, cultural and 
    geographical barriers to education, we set out to make high-quality 
    education more affordable and accessible to our students.
