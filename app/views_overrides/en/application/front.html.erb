  Currently, the educational systems in many of the Arab countries are failing to 
  meet the basic needs and aspirations of their constituent students, leaving 
  them on their own when it comes to acquiring the basic knowledge and skills 
  that can make a difference in their lives. At Duroosi School we are working 
  hard to change that. Taking into account the economic, cultural and 
  geographical barriers to education, we set out to make high-quality 
  education more affordable and accessible to our students.
